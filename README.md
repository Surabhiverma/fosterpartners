# Foster &amp; Partners: A simple webapp for selecting a concrete mix 

This is a small web application developed using React JS to render a component for concrete selection. Based on the concrete selection is displayed a horizontal bar chart. I used material-ui components to style them according to the material design system. This is developed as part of a recruitment requirement.
